# Optimized AWS Cloud Infrastructure with VPCs
> A scalable and secure AWS cloud infrastructure project that utilizes an Application Load Balancer and multi-AZ deployment to achieve 99.9% uptime.

---

## üöÄ Features / Key Highlights
- Implemented AWS VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- Configured NAT Gateways to provide secure outbound internet access for private subnet instances.
- Automated Application Load Balancer deployment with HTTPS termination and path-based routing to distribute traffic efficiently.
- Established Auto Scaling groups for application servers enabling self-healing and dynamic scaling based on load.
- Enforced least-privilege security with Security Groups and Network ACLs for detailed firewall control.
